--requirement requirements.bot.txt
--requirement requirements.render.txt

# Note: dependencies are split into two files for clarity:
# - requirements.bot.txt  : dependencies needed to run the Telegram bot + monitor
# - requirements.render.txt : dependencies for the render service (Playwright, S3, etc.)

# You can still install everything via this file which includes both sets.
